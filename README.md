# Package GEONE
GEONE is a python package providing a set of tools for geostatistical and multiple-point statistics modeling, comprising:
   - multiple-point statistics (MPS) - DEESSE wrapper
   - Gaussian random fields (GRF)
   - other classical geostatistical tools (two-point statistics analysis (covariance, variogram, connectivity) / simulation (SGS, SIS) / estimation (kriging))
   - pluri-Gaussian simulation
   - other algorithms based on random processes (Poisson point process, Chentsov simulation)


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/randlab/geone.git`
cd geone
pip install .
```

 **Remove geone**

`pip uninstall -y geone`

*Note: first remove the directory 'geone.egg-info' from the current directory.*

## Using GEONE
 
Do not launch python from the directory where the installation has been done (with `pip`), otherwise `import geone` will fail.

## Requirements
The following python packages are used by GEONE:
   - matplotlib
   - numpy (tested with version 1.21.5)
   - pyvista (tested with version 0.36.1)
   - scipy (tested with version 1.7.3)

## Important notes 
GEONE includes a *DEESSE wrapper* to directly launch DEESSE within python. The DEESSE version provided with GEONE is a test version with restricted capabilities. To unlock the full capabilities of DEESSE, the user must obtain a commercial or academic license from the University of Neuch√¢tel. See LICENSE file for details.

Note also that the DEESSE wrapper is built for python3.6 / python3.7 / python3.8 / python3.9 / python3.10.

## Examples
Some modules in the package GEONE can be run as a script ('\_\_main\_\_' scope) and provide examples by this way.
