# Package GEONE
GEONE is a python package providing a set of tools for geostatistical and multiple-point statistics modeling, comprising:
   - multiple-point statistics (MPS) - DEESSE wrapper
   - gaussian random fields (GRF)
   - other classical geostatistical tools (two-point statistics analysis (covariance, variogram, connectivity) / simulation (SGS, SIS) / estimation (kriging))

## Installation
To install the package: `python3 -m pip install .`

To uninstall the package: `python3 -m pip uninstall -y geone`

(To install the package in development mode (enable editing): `python3 -m pip install -e .`)

## Requirements
The following python packages are used by 'geone':
   - numpy
   - scipy
   - matplotlib
   - mpl_toolkits
   - pyvista

**Important note**:  
GEONE includes a *DEESSE wrapper* to directly launch DEESSE within python. The DEESSE version provided with GEONE is a test version with restricted capabilities. To unlock the full capabilities of DEESSE, the user must obtain a commercial or academic license from the University of Neuch√¢tel. See LICENSE file for details.

Note also that the DEESSE wrapper is built for python3.6 / python3.7 / python3.8 / python3.9.

## Examples
Some modules in the package GEONE can be run as a script ('\_\_main\_\_' scope) and provide examples by this way.
