# Package GEONE
GEONE is a python package providing a set of tools for geostatistical and multiple-point statistics modeling, comprising:
   - multiple-point statistics (MPS) - DEESSE wrapper
   - Gaussian random fields (GRF) - following a method based on (block) circulant embedding of the covariance matrix and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
   - other classical geostatistical tools (two-point statistics analysis (covariance, variogram, connectivity) / simulation (SGS, SIS) / estimation (kriging))
   - pluri-Gaussian simulation (PGS)
   - other algorithms based on random processes (Poisson point process, Chentsov simulation)


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/randlab/geone.git
cd geone
pip install .
```

 **Remove geone**

`pip uninstall -y geone`

*Note: first remove the directory 'geone.egg-info' from the current directory (if present).*

## Using GEONE

Do not launch python from the directory where the installation has been done (with `pip`), otherwise `import geone` will fail.

## Requirements
The following python packages are used by GEONE (tested on python 3.10.9):
   - matplotlib (3.6.2)
   - multiprocessing (for parallel processes)
   - numpy (tested with version 1.23.5)
     pandas (tested with version 1.5.2)
   - pyvista (tested with version 0.38.5)
   - scipy (tested with version 1.10.0)

## Important notes
- GEONE includes a *DEESSE wrapper* to directly launch DEESSE within python. The DEESSE version provided with GEONE is a test version with restricted capabilities. **To unlock the full capabilities of DEESSE, the user must obtain a commercial or academic license from the University of Neuch√¢tel. See LICENSE file for details.**
- DEESSE and some other geostatistical tools provided by GEONE are compiled in C for windows and linux, and for python3.6 to python3.10. **Note that for linux, the provided libraries depend on the library GLIBC 2.35, hence the library GLIBC of your OS has to be compatible with that version to ensure proper operation of GEONE.**

## DEESSE - Introduction
DEESSE is a parallel software for multiple point statistics (MPS) simulations. MPS allows to generate random fields reproducing the spatial statistics -- within and between variable(s) -- of a training data set (TDS). DEESSE follows an approach based on the *direct sampling* of the TDS. The simulation grid is sequentially populated by values borrowed from the TDS, selected after a random search for similar patterns. Many features are handled by DEESSE and illustrated in the proposed examples below.

DEESSE can also be used for 3D simulation based on 2D TDS which give the spatial statistics in sections (slices) of the 3D simulation domain. (More generally, 1D or 2D TDS can be used for higher dimensional simulation.) The principle consists in filling the simulation domain by successively simulating sections (according the the given orientation) conditionally to the sections previously simulated. A wrapper for this approach (named DEESSEX referring to crossing-simulation / X-simulation with DEESSE) is proposed in the package GEONE.

## Examples
Some modules in the package GEONE can be run as a script ('\_\_main\_\_' scope) and provide examples by this way.

Various examples are provided (notebooks in 'examples' directory) to get started with GEONE, as described below.
